# Markdown Viewer (GNOME Shell Extension)

A minimal GNOME Shell extension that displays and toggles tasks from a Markdown file, Kanban-style.  
Supports checkboxes and section headers (##), and writes back to the Markdown file.  
Ideal for simple TODO workflows right from your top bar!

*Note: This extension works for GNOME 48+*

- Displays sections and tasks from a markdown file.
- Recognizes `[ ]` (incomplete) and `[x]` (complete) tasks.
- Toggle task state with a click.
- Custom SVG icon support.
- Simple preferences panel to select the file.
